# TMR4160 - Dynamic Positioning project Spring 2018

This project used phidget interface to control and visualize the movement of a boat in a pool. A basic PID controller regulates
the movement of the boat, so that it will stabilize quickly in desired position. 

The visualization was done through
openGL as well as using the output data in plotting software.
